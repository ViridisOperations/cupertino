# cupertino

Project Goal: To identify selling price of a home in Cupertino, California, USA
DataSet : Primary DataSet collected by me (168 houses sold in cupertino in last 12 months). 
Raw data is available at https://github.com/sudhirwadhwa/cupertino/blob/master/trainingdataset_cupertino.csv
Description: I wanted to see the fair value of my house based on Data. 
A real estate agent told me, I can get 2 million USD for my house, another one told me, 
I could only get 1.4 Million. This difference was huge ( 600,000 USD). 
I decided to find out what is the fair value, based on houses sold in Cupertino. 

I used Linear Regression method to predict 
the value of my house. Input value is going to be Total Square foot 
( for example 2700 Sq Ft), 
output value should be simply fair market price ( for example 1,500,000 USD)

The Repo has ui.R , server.R and dataset which was used in prediction 

Note: I collected the primary data from Cupertino by interviewing several real estate agents.
I got roughly 168 observations , based on that , I predicted the fair vale of a house in cupertino.

App is simple to use: You input the Square foot of a house in Cupertino,
App will output the fair value of the house in USD.

I plan to make the prediction more accurate, by using #of bed rooms , bath rooms , school in future.
I also plan to expand to other counties in USA. If you want to work with me on the project,
please contact me.
